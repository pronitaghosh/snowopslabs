# CLAUDE.md

**SnowOps Labs** — a Kubernetes platform-engineering simulator. `labctl` (Go
CLI) stands up a local production-shaped cluster, runs declarative scenarios,
injects reversible faults, and grades the fix. Go 1.25, built on the toolchain
pinned in `src/go.mod` + React 18/Vite/TS UI (embedded in the binary) + POSIX
shell/helm/kubectl for all cluster work.

## Read this first

**[docs/AGENT-CONTEXT.md](docs/AGENT-CONTEXT.md)** is the working contract: the
routing table telling you which single document answers your task, every
invariant, and the definition of done.

Documentation is the source of truth. Trust it instead of re-deriving facts from
the source — that is the main way tokens get burned here. When a doc and the
code disagree, fix the doc in the same change.

## Layout

- `src/` — the Go module (`github.com/sagar2395/snowopslabs`) and the UI. **Run
  `go` and `make` targets from here.**
  - `src/cmd/labctl/` entrypoint · `src/internal/` implementation ·
    `src/pkg/` exported SDK · `src/ui/` React app · `src/services/` in-cluster
    helpers such as the k6 traffic generator
- `engine/`, `make/`, `platform/`, `runtimes/` — shell and helm orchestration
  that Go invokes
- `scenarios/`, `incidents/`, `challenges/`, `learn/`, `apps/` — declarative
  YAML and scripts
- `config/versions.env` — tool minimums **and** every chart pin
- `docs/` — the source of truth

## Commands

```bash
make cli-build      # build bin/labctl with the UI embedded
make ui-dev         # serve src/ui/dist live, no Go rebuild
make test           # Go unit + apps + shell (bats), -race, coverage gate
make test-go        # Go unit + contract tests (>=80% per package)
make test-ui        # vitest component tests
make test-e2e       # playwright journeys
make lint           # fmt-check + shell + Go + UI lint + sec + vuln
make fmt            # gofmt the tree
make docs-check     # documentation is in step with the code
```

From `src/ui/`: `npm run test`, `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run typecheck`.

## The four loops

`labctl init` (build) → `labctl scenario up <name>` (simulate) →
`labctl incident inject <name>` (break) → `labctl scenario verify <name>`
(measure). Commands: [CLI reference](docs/reference/cli/index.md).

Providers are swappable via `.env` or CLI vars — `INGRESS_PROVIDER`,
`METRICS_PROVIDER`, `LOGGING_PROVIDER`, `TRACING_PROVIDER`, with
`PROFILE=k3d|kind|incluster`. Per-app config is `apps/<name>/app.env`.

## Go skills

Load the `golang-how-to` skill (cc-skills-golang) before writing, reviewing or
refactoring any Go code, and follow the skills it routes to. Where a skill and
[GO-CONVENTIONS](docs/GO-CONVENTIONS.md) differ, GO-CONVENTIONS wins (e.g. error
text says what to do next).

## Hard rules

The full set is in [AGENT-CONTEXT](docs/AGENT-CONTEXT.md#invariants). The ones
most often broken:

- POSIX shell only; no cgo; no `grep -P`, `sed -i` without a backup, `readlink -f`
  or `date -d`.
- Go orchestrates, scripts do the work. Never `exec.Command(...).Run()` — go
  through `internal/run` with a context, timeout and lock key.
- Scenarios, incidents, checks and learning paths are YAML plus scripts, never
  hardcoded Go.
- One values file per component; every chart pinned; `/api/v2` only;
  instrumentation is middleware, never per-handler.
- Comments (Go, shell, TypeScript, YAML) say **what the code does and why it
  is needed**, in the present tense, under three lines. They never tell the
  story behind a change: no bug or incident that prompted it, no decision or
  alternative considered, no measurements or logs, no "used to" / "once" /
  "no longer", no task or ticket numbers. That belongs in the commit message.
- Tests are table-driven and hermetic. No live cluster, network or real
  credentials.
- Never land code without updating the docs it affects in the same change.
- Don't commit build artifacts (`bin/`, `dist/`, `coverage.out`, `src/ui/dist/`).

## Traps that cost a day each

Full detail lives with the subject; these are the pointers.

- **Observability** — kube-prometheus-stack's empty selectors, Tempo on port
  3200, Kafka's two metric sources, Promtail relabelling, k6's seconds-not-
  milliseconds: [R13](docs/runbooks/R13-observability-pipeline.md).
- **Helm** — `upgrade` and `uninstall` both ignore CRDs; most of a StatefulSet
  spec is immutable, so use `helm_upgrade_install` from `platform/_lib/helm.sh`:
  [R05](docs/runbooks/R05-platform-components.md).
- **Scenario authoring** — `platformValues` vs `valuesFile`, `adopt`,
  `uninstallScript`, `pending` checks:
  [scenario schema](docs/reference/scenario-schema.md).
