# has proved cert-manager works, but nothing is actually protected until the
# Ingress serves it. So this asserts on the wire, not on the manifest.
#
# The handshake is the outcome. Traefik answers 443 either way — with its own
# CN=TRAEFIK DEFAULT CERT when no route matches, or with the lab-signed leaf
# once the Ingress references the Secret. Only the second one passes.
