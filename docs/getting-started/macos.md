# Getting started on macOS

Works on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

## What you need

- **Homebrew.** If you don't have it, `labctl init` installs it; that is the one
  step that asks for your password.
- **2 CPUs and 4 GB of memory for Docker**, more to run several scenarios at
  once ([Resources](../resources.md)).
- **About 10 GB of free disk.**

You don't need Docker Desktop. `labctl init` installs
[colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima), a lightweight Docker VM, with
Homebrew and starts it at 2 CPU / 4 GB. If you already use Docker Desktop, the
lab uses it instead; give it at least 2 CPUs and 4 GB under Settings →
Resources.

## Install and build the lab

Clone the latest release wherever you keep projects, then install the matching
`labctl` and build the lab:

```bash
git clone --branch stable https://github.com/sagar2395/snowopslabs.git
cd snowopslabs
./install.sh
labctl init
```

`git` comes with Apple's Command Line Tools; if they are missing, the first
`git` command offers to install them. `install.sh` puts `labctl` in
`~/.local/bin` and records your clone, so `labctl` works from any directory.

`init` installs `kubectl`, `helm`, `k3d`, `colima`, `docker` and
`docker-buildx` with Homebrew (a tool you already have at a new enough version
is left alone), starts colima, creates the cluster and installs the platform.
It finishes with the lab's URLs. Then:

```bash
labctl ui                  # http://localhost:3939
```

## Giving colima more memory

Set the size in `.env` in your clone; `labctl init` starts a *stopped* colima
at that size, and never shrinks it:

```bash
LAB_CPUS=4
LAB_MEMORY=8
```

A colima that is already running is never resized for you, because restarting
it stops your other containers. Resize it yourself, then bring the lab back:

```bash
colima stop && colima start --cpu 4 --memory 8
labctl init
```

## After a reboot

colima does not start on its own. Run `labctl init`: it starts colima at the
lab's size, restarts the cluster and waits until everything is Ready, keeping
your apps and scenarios.

## Uninstall

```bash
labctl teardown
labctl hosts remove                  # only if you added hosts entries for an older lab
rm -rf ~/.snowops ~/.local/bin/labctl   # and your clone, when you no longer need it
colima delete --data                 # removes the VM and every image in it
```

`colima delete` without `--data` keeps Docker's images and containers for the
next VM.
